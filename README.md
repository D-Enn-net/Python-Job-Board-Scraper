# Python Job Board Scraper

A Python script that scrapes job listings from the official python.org/jobs board, processes the data, and saves it to a clean CSV file. This project demonstrates skills in web scraping, data manipulation, and professional code organization.

## üöÄ Features

-   Fetches data from a live website (`python.org/jobs`).
-   Parses HTML using BeautifulSoup to extract specific job details.
-   Handles missing or inconsistent data points gracefully.
-   Organizes the extracted data into a structured table using the pandas library.
-   Saves the final, clean data to a `python_jobs.csv` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Python 3**
-   **Requests:** For making HTTP requests to the website.
-   **BeautifulSoup4:** For parsing HTML content.
-   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and saving to CSV.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

2.  Install the necessary libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
    ```
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
4.  A file named `python_jobs.csv` will be created in the same directory.
